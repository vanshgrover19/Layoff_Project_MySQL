# Layoff_Project_MySQL
This project demonstrates my expertise in cleaning and analyzing datasets using MySQL. Leveraging Common Table Expressions (CTEs), INSERT and UPDATE statements, JOINs, and DELETE operations, I meticulously cleaned the data, standardizing column data types, updating incorrect values, removing duplicates, and dropping unnecessary columns. Subsequently, I employed MySQL queries, including SELECT statements and CTEs, to extract valuable insights from the cleaned dataset, uncovering patterns and trends. This project showcases my proficiency in data management and analysis, highlighting my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using MySQL.
